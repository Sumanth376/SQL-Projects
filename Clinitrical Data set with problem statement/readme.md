# ü©∫ Clinical Trial SQL Project ‚Äì Patient Record Analysis

This project simulates the use of SQL to manage and analyze patient data collected from a clinical drug trial. The dataset includes health indicators such as blood pressure, cholesterol, pregnancy status, and drug reaction observations. Through this analysis, we derive insights about the sample group and demonstrate SQL operations for data exploration, cleaning, and categorization.

| `Chlstrl`        | Cholesterol level (removed later)                          |
| `Age`            | Age in years                                               |
| `Pregnant`       | Indicates if the patient is pregnant (`yes` or `no`)       |
